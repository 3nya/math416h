# Basis Length does not Depend on Basis

Any two bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same length.


## Proof

Let $B_1, B_2$ be two bases for a vector space $V$. $B_1$ is linearly indepdent
and $B_2$ spans $V$, so by [[Length of Linearly Independent List]] length of
$B_1$ <= length of $B_2$. Switching the roles of $B_1$ and $B_2$ reveals length
of $B_2$ <= length of $B_1$. Thus both bases must be the same length.
