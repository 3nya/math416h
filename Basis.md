A basis of $V$ is a list of vectors that is [[Linear independence|linearly independent]] and [[Span|spans]] $V$.


## Properties
A list of $v_1, ... , v_n$ of vectors in $V$ is a basis of $V$ $\iff$ every $v \in V$ can be written uniquely in the form

$v = a_1v_1 + ... + a_nv_n$ for $a_1, ..., a_n \in \mathbb{F}$
[[Property of Basis|proof]]

A [[span|spanning list]] in a vector space 

Every [[Finite dimensional|finite dimensional]] vector space has a basis.
Being finite dimensional tells us that the vector space has some spanning list.
