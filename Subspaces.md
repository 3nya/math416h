A subset $U$ of $V$ is called a subspace of $V$ (denoted $U \leq V$)
if the following conditions hold:

## To be a subspace
Additive identity
$0 \in U$.

Closed under addition
for $u, v \in U$
$u + v \in U$.

Closed under multiplication
for $a \in \mathbb{F}$ and $u \in U$
$au \in U$

## Sum of subspaces

Suppose $V_1 ... V_m$ are subspaces of $V$. The sum of $V_1, ... V_m$ (denoted as $V_1 + ... + V_m$) is the set of all possible sums of elements $V_1 ... V_m$.

$V_1 + ... + V_m = \{v_1 + ... + v_m : v_1 \in V_1, ... v_m \in V_m\}$

## Direct sums

A special case of the sum of subspaces where each vector in $V_1 , ... , V_m$ can only be written in one way as a sum $v_1 + ... + v_m$ where each $v_k \in V_k$. 

Denoted by 
$V_1 + ... + V_m$ is a direct sum = $V_1 \oplus ... \oplus V_m$

### easier way to verify a direct sum
$V_1 + ... + V_m$ is a direct sum if and only if the only way to write $0$ as a sum of $v_1 + ... + v_m$ is if each $v_k$ is equal to 0.

Additionally:
$U \oplus W \iff U \cap W = {0}$
