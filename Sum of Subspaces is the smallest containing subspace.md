Suppose $V_1, ..., V_m$ are subspaces of $V$.

We want to show that $V_1 + ... + V_m$ is the smallest subspace of $V$ that contains $V_1, ... , V_m$.

First verify that $V_1 + ... + V_m$ is a subspace

0 exists
closed under addition
closed under multiplication

By the definition of $V_1 + ... + V_m$, we know that $V_1 ,... ,V_m$ is contained within $V_1 + ... + V_m$.

Every subspace of $V$ that contains $V_1 , ... , V_m$ must also contain $V_1 + ... + V_m$, since a subspace must contain all sums of their elements. 

Therefore, $V_1 + ... + V_m$ is the smallest subspace that contains all $V_1 , ... , V_m$
